# Automated Finance Tracker

This project is an automated program that reads bank statements specifically for itemization in regards to tax filling.
The PDF file passed through the function will be parsed and the program will read each page.
Afterwards, the text will be extracted and the PDF will be re-named according to:

* Institution names
* Account type
* Month/Year

After text extraction, the program locates and extracts any business related payments/compensation and taxable expenses
into a spreadsheet format.
